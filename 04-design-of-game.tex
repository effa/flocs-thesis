\chapter{Design of Programming Game}
\label{chap:design-of-game}

%% Terminology + importance.
Design of a programming game deserves a careful attention,
because tasks are the most important part of a system for learning programming.
%...since...
They are the means for learning,
and students spent nearly all the time in the system by solving them.
% TODO: terminology: game, task, PS
% NOTE: rule of the loop + strategy: prototyping several ideas, measure
% metrics to see which games work best.

%% Requirements.
% ... "Therefore" (to link it to the importance in prev paragraph)
To support engagement, tasks must be fun, entertaining,
and immediately appeal to be solved.  % TODO: Fix English.
%(TODO: mention how we underestimated the importance of the entertaining tasks in the first prototype)
To enable learning, the game must allow for tasks requiring all basic
programming concepts, such as sequence of commands, loops, and conditional
statements. % repeat, while, if, if-else, simple tests (comparing)
To enable outer-loop adaptive behavior, multiple diverse tasks practicing same
concepts are needed, including a lot of tasks using only sequences of commands
without more advanced programming constructs.
% (TODO?: other requirements mentioned in the prev. chapters (+REF?)

% TODO: Ideally, mimic and refer to the sections in the chapter on Learning Programming
% (how we incorporated the strategies for easier learning and for motivation)

We have designed a simple game which is a variation on a robot
on grid with a space theme, and which uses Blockly for building programs
(\cref{fig:robomission-task2}).
This choices support all main strategies for easier learning of programming
(\cref{sec:strategies-for-easier-learning}),
including
avoiding syntax errors by using block-based programming,
showing a visual output (the grid world),
and providing short instructions and explanations. % TODO: elaborate?
We combine several strategies to support motivation (\cref{sec:motivation}),
such as appealing game world, entertaing tasks, progress through levels,
and recommending tasks of optimal difficulty
(adaptivity is discussed in \cref{chap:design-of-adaptivity}).
% TODO: target group: Currently, the system primarily targets at children
%  between 10-15 years? (or simply primary school)

% TODO: Img: English localization.

\section{Game World}  % Space World
\label{sec:robomission.game-world}

The game world itself should be pleasure to look at and fun to play with,
even without a specific task to solve \cite{book-of-lenses}.
We have based the game world on a popular choice of a robot on grid,
using a theme of a spaceship flying through space and collecting diamonds
(\cref{fig:spaceworld}).
% TODO: better word than "popular"?
%% Game elements.
Each field in the \epmh{space world} has a background color, which
the spaceship can read and use for decisions (e.g. turning left on red fields).
In addition to the spaceship controlled by the student,
there are the following game objects:
% there are a few other game objects: %, that can reside on one of the fields.
%These are
diamonds, that need to be collected,
large asteroids, that destroy the spaceship if it hits them,
small meteoroids, that can be shooted,
and wormholes that serves as teleports.

The spaceships start on the bottom row and it always moves one row forward
after any action. % towards its final destination (the last row).
% TODO: elaborate / illustrative figure showing a step and a path
In addition to flying and turning, the spacehsip can also shoot small meteroids.
Having these four basic actions (fly, left, right, shoot) already allows for a
diversity of simple tasks which only practice sequence of commands.
% TODO: limited energy, in order to force thinking about whether to fly or shoot
The spaceship has two sensors, one for the color under the spaceship, and
second for its horizontal position (column index). Having two different sensors allows
for diverse tasks practicing conditions, including testing inequalities, and
potentially also compound conditions.

An inovative feature of the game is the default forward movement,
%where turning results in a shift to a neighboring column
%and each action (including turning) are linked with a forward movement.
which results in shorter programs.
For example, to fly around a stone, only two commands are needed % (left, right),
instead of either 4 or 8 (depending on whether the available commands include
movement in any of the four directions, or only forward movement and turning)
(REF:fig).
% 4: LFFR (e.g. in StarWars game), 8: LFRFFRFL
% TODO: or 4 as a semi-step (single direction OR default movement)
Furthermore, as the spaceship is always facing up, a common left-right
confusion is mitigated (CITE).
Wormholes allow to reuse rows to avoid too long worlds.  % TODO: elaborate?
% (more possible remedies available options available)


%\item movement -- always 1 row forward ("continuous flight ahead") --
%  advantages:
%  (1) mitigates ubiquitous left-right turning confusion;
%  (2) shorter programs (REF example);
%  disadvantages:
%  (1) this behavior is different than what most users initially expect
%  (2) underutilization of fields (only 1 field in each row and only once)
%      (leading to long worlds).
%\item chosen remedy for the 2nd disadvantage: worm holes
%  % (another possibilities: multiple spaceships, long worlds)

%\begin{itemize}
%\item original version - robot-in-maze, issues:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item not flexible and did not allow for a lot of diverse easy tasks,
%  \item which is crucial for adaptive learning system
%  \item unnecessarily long programs for simple ideas (non-elegant programs) (TBA: show comparision)
%  \item non-elegant tasks
%  \item ugly worlds
%  \item not very original and entertaining for kids
%  \end{itemize}
%\item requirements (on the topic/theme/world):
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item entertaining for children
%  \item allowing to create plenty of diverse (and entertaining) tasks, inluding very simple ones
%  \item programs should be not too verbose
%  \item not limiting adaptability (e.g. story requring a fixed sequence of tasks would be a problem)
%  \item (not limiting another topics later)
%  \end{itemize}
%\item fully observable world
%\item no chance (randomness would complicate evaluation and interpretation
%  of data) (there is still some \emph{surprise} in the game for the players:
%  ``Will my program solve the task or not?'')
%%\item REF to formal grammar for the space world in the next chapter
%\end{itemize}

% TODO: use different spaceworld than in Imlementation chapter.

%\imgW{prototype-pits}{Lesson from the first prototype: world must contain
%elements that the program cannot check to enable diverse tasks. As we had a
%natural sensor to check walls, we needed to add pits that could not be checked
%by any sensor.}


\section{Tasks and Programs}
\label{sec:robomission.programs}

Each task asks the student to create a program in Blockly,
that would guide the spaceship safely to the last row,
collecting all diamonds on its way (REF:fig-below).
% Advantage: very clear and intuitive goal
Setting of a task consists of a space world description,
% as described in the previous section
limits for the length of the program and the number of shots,
and available programming blocks. % toolbox
The student can execute her current program as many times
as she wish, until her program is correct.

%% Blocks.
The set of available blocks is gradually expanding with
increasing level. This \emph{toolbox standardization}
is easier for both task creators (it is enough to specify
one of a few standard toolboxes, instead of name all available blocks
for each task), and students (available blocks are not changing
chaotically with easch task).
%- available blocks: depending on the level (sweet spot between chaotically changing toolbox with each task and overloading by all commands from the beginning
% NOTE: blocks: actions (...), sensing (...), repeat, while, if, if-else;
The easiest tasks use only action commands (fly, left, right, shoot),
while the more advanced tasks offer repeat loop, while loop, if and if-else statements,
and tests for colors and position.
No special test for the last row is needed, since all tasks follow a convention
of coloring the last row by blue color.

%% Programs
In order to simplify future learning of a textual programming language,
we made the text on blocks match a Python syntax, % translated to Czech in Czech localization
with the exception of the repeat block, where the Python equivalent
(\texttt{for i in range(5)}) is more difficult to understand for beginners
then simple \texttt{repeat 5}.
% NOTE: in future, this allows for AB experiments
%comparing directly the influence of the text/block environment as done e.g.
%in the field study in \cite{comparing-blocks-text-weintrop2017}.

%% Limits.
There are two limits that a task can specify.
The \emph{length} limit defines maximum number of statements
in the program. Limit on number of statements instead of blocks was chosen in
order to make the limit smaller number and thus the counting easier.
As a bonus, this definition could be used for textual programming as well.
% which is not case for the blocks limit
This limit forces students to use loops instead of a long sequence of
actions.
The \emph{energy} limit controls for the number
of performed shots. Without this limit, students could always use
shooting without thinking when they really need it.

\clearpage  % just to mark the room for the figure


\section{Problem Sets}


% NOTE: term ``level design''

RoboMission contains over 80 tasks divided into 9 problem sets (levels)
(\cref{fig:robomission-tasks-overview}).
The levels were originally created manually, based on the required blocks
and a difficulty estimated by us. Later, after some performance data
were collected we have further decomposed the levels into two-level
hierarchy to enforce prerequisities between them and we moved
a few tasks into levels that better match their observed
difficulty among students.
% NOTE: But the observed difficulty depends on the context, such as
% the level, the task is presented in.

\imgW[0.75]{robomission-tasks-overview}{RoboMission contains 9 levels, each with about 8-10 tasks.}

As a motivational element which helps to satisfy the need of progress,
students earn credits for each solved task and they progress to
next level when they receive a sufficient number of credits
(\cref{fig:robomission-levels-credits}).

\imgW[0.75]{robomission-levels-credits}{Students earn credits after each solved task.}


\section{Instructions and Explanations}

Clear instructions and hints are another strategy to make the learning easier
(\cref{sec:instructions-and-hints}).
We combine simple adaptive instructions and post-event explanations.
When a student encounters a new programming concept or a game element,
the system displays a short instruction (\cref{fig:robomission-mini-instruction}).
% NOTE: They are adaptive in the way that they only show the first time student encounter
% the concept.

% TODO: Update text and images to match the current state and to be more readable
% (cut out the relevant part of the screenshot).
\imgW[0.78]{robomission-mini-instruction}{Mini instruction for a new game concept.}

Furthermore, the system provides short explanations after each unsuccessful execution,
describing why it was unsuccessful,
e.g. some diamonds were not collected,
or the spaceship has not reached the final row.
% NOTE: simple inner-loop reflexive agent

%\imgW{prototype-instructions}{Instructions in the first prototype. Nobody was reading them. Most people even did not notice there are any instructions.}

\section{Game Editor}  % OR: task editor?
\label{sec:robomission.task-editor}

The online Game Editor (\cref{fig:task-editor})
helps to create new tasks easily.
In the editor, the task creator immediately sees visualization of the space world,
he can test a solution in either Blockly or its text-based equivalent (\emph{RoboCode})
(\cref{fig:task-editor-vim}),
and import or export tasks via a custom Markdown-based format.
%(TODO: mention how inconvenient it was in the first prototype, especially the tokens...)
The editor is a part of the public site, so even students can create their own new tasks.
% Which support the need of creativity; + potentially allows to get a lot of tasks into
% the system, which is could be interesting for adaptivity.

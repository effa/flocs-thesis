\chapter{Design of RoboMission}
\label{chap:design-of-robomission}

\begin{itemize}
\item RoboMission = app for efficient and fun learning of elementary programming for children (= mission)
\item how: entertaining problems of optimal difficulty $\rightarrow$ max \emph{flow} $\rightarrow$ max fun, learning efficiency, happiness
\item "robot in grid world" and Blockly blocks
\item theme: spaceship in space, collecting diamonds
\item covered concepts: sequences of commands, repeat, while, if, if-else, simple tests (comparing)
\item linearized description: design (this chapter), implementation (next chapter); in reality: many iterations
\end{itemize}

\section{System Behavior}
\label{sec:robomission.behavior}

Wide range of task difficulty, together with the adaptive behavior,
should make the systems useful for anybody who wants to learn
elementary programming.
However, this long-term goal requires many iterations,
as well as a lot of data.
Currently, the system primarily targets at children between 8-15 years.

\subsection{Main Use Case}
\label{sec:robomission.use-case}

\begin{itemize}
\item Student visits the home page of the project, reads the "promotional slides" and tries the game with manual controls. On the last slide, they click on the recommended task from the 1st level.
(REF: img)
\item Student creates the program using Blockly blocks and can run the program as many times as needed. (REF: img) Program execution is visualized. Student can change the speed of the execution.
\item After each unsuccessful execution, a short message explaining why the task was not solved is shown (e.g. "The spaceship must reach the final row.") (REF: img)
\item Student is able to solve the first few tasks quickly (within 2 minutes).
\item After solving each task, student is shown a visualization of obtaining points (called credits) (REF: printscreen). After a few solved tasks, student progresses to next level.
\item After each solved task, student is shown a dialog with one recommended task, and also a link to the page with overview of all tasks (REF: img).
\item Student is able to solve any task recommended by the system (within 15 minutes).
\item Each new concept (e.g. block) is explained in the task where it appears for the first time. (REF: img), so the student understands all elements in the game world and blocks available in the toolbox.
\item Students with some prior programming skill should progress through first few levels quickly (within 10 minutes) and get to the more challenging tasks containing both types of loops, conditionals etc.
\item Student is not bored by neither too easy task requiring many commands (i.e. taking more than 1 minute to build the streightforward solution), nor by the sequence of either too easy or too similar tasks.
\item Student can sign up (or log in without registration through their social accounts) at any moment to save their progress. Even without singing up, the system can associate the student with its progress using session cookie (but also provides a button to clear the history).
\item Student can provide a feedback or report a bug easily (and the feedback is send to admins by an email).
\end{itemize}
(TBA: add diagram with images for all these steps linked by arrows showing transitions)

% TODO: consider some of the following notes
% - Design of tasks for the system is described in section \ref{sec:robomission.tasks}.
% - Adaptive aspect of the behavior is described in section \ref{sec:robomission.adaptability}.
%\item intuitive and simple user interface crucial (aiming at children, they need to focus on learning programming, it would be bad to waste their mental power on understanding a complex interface)
%\item mini-instructions (ref to the Google research on ignoring instructions, show how it was solved in Blockly Games; ref figure)
%\item mini-explations (difference from instructions: after the fact) (ref figure) (they also serve as a convenient mean to game resetting)
%\item motivation: intrinsic (fun challenging game + optimal difficulty) and simple external motivation scheme: credits and levels


\subsection{Four Modes of Usage}
\label{sec:robomission.use-cases}

In addition to the main use case described in the previous section,
which assumes a new student without any context (e.g. a classroom),
the system can be potentially used in other (or more specific) ways.

\begin{itemize}
\item "Hour of Code" mode
  \begin{itemize}
  \item single hour
  \item mainly as a motivation to programming
  \item using RoboBlocks
  \item directly at elemenatry and high schools, or at home
  \item plus: MjUNI workshop
  \item shorter promotianal version for DODs (?) ("10 minutes of code")
  \item (should be strictly time-limited; certificate at the end)
  \end{itemize}
\item "Foundations mode" individual learning of elementary programming (individual at home or in a classroom, from several days to several weeks, depending on the prior skill); natural continuation of the first "Hour of Code" (next levels, with RoboBlocks)
\item "University mode" -- levels with RoboCode/Python, at home / secondary schools, KSI (0th problem set), IB111 (0th/1st motivational lesson - needs Python and to be better than turtle)
\item "Competition mode" -- competitions such as Purkiada, Pevnost FI, KSI (advanced problem sets), new FIBot (physical version already in InterSoB 2017); this also includes testing mode for RH interns
\end{itemize}

All these modes can be naturally implemented as distinct levels,
going from the easy tasks using RoboBlocks for "Hour of Code",
gradually transitioning to the RoboCode during learning the "Foundations",
using full-fledged Python for "University mode"
and offering both blocks and Python for the individual competitions.
Levels from the past compettions can be made public for all students.


\section{Tasks}
\label{sec:robomission.tasks}

Tasks are the most important part of the system,
because nearly all the time in the system students spend solving the tasks.
Therefore they need to be fun, entertaining and calling to be solved.
(TODO: ref to the other requirements mentioned in the prev. chapters)
(TODO: also mention how we underestimated the importance of the entertaining tasks in the first prototype)

\subsection{Game World}
\label{sec:robomission.game-world}

\begin{itemize}
\item original version - robot-in-maze, issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item not flexible and did not allow for a lot of diverse easy tasks,
  \item which is crucial for adaptive learning system
  \item unnecessarily long programs for simple ideas (non-elegant programs) (TBA: show comparision)
  \item non-elegant tasks
  \item ugly worlds
  \item not very original and entertaining for kids
  \end{itemize}
\item principle: game itself must be fun to play with (ref: Book of Lenses)
\item requirements (on the topic/theme/world):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item entertaining for children
  \item allowing to create plenty of diverse (and entertaining) tasks, inluding very simple ones
  \item programs should be not too verbose
  \item not limiting adaptability (e.g. story requring a fixed sequence of tasks would be a problem)
  \item (not limiting another topics later)
  \end{itemize}
\item new game: rocket in space - different theme, mechanics, graphics
\item world elements: grid with colored fields (color clouds) and objects: asteroids and meteoroids, diamonds, wormholes (TODO: explain why), final line, spaceship
\item spaceship actions (left, fly, right, shoot) and sensors (color, position), limited energy
\item explain (and demonstrate) the usefulness of continuous flight ahead (shorter programs, eliminate the common turning left-right confusion), but also disadvantages: (1) more difficult to use space effiently, this was partially solved by the wormholes hack, another potential solution: more spaceships), (2) it is not what users expect the first time they see the world and left/right action
\item REF to formal grammar for the space world in the next chapter
\end{itemize}


% TODO: use different spaceworld than in Imlementation chapter.
\imgW[0.4]{spaceworld}{Example of Space World.}

\subsection{Programs}
\label{sec:robomission.programs}

Given an instace of a spaceworld as described in the previous section (input),
the goal is to create a program for the spaceship such that
it reaches the final row and collects all diamonds on the way.

\begin{itemize}
\item length limit, (energy limit)
\item Blockly blocks (+ potentially RoboCode based on Python, ref to grammar in next chapter)
\item blocks: depends on the level, actions (...), sensing (...), repeat, while, if, if-else
\end{itemize}

TODO: desing decision: similar to Python as much as possible: for easy transition
(see the transitional strategies section in chapter 2), allows for AB experiments
comparing directly the influence of the text/block environment as done e.g.
in the field study in \cite{comparing-blocks-text-weintrop2017}.

\imgW{prototype-pits}{Lesson from the first prototype: world must contain elements that the program cannot check to enable diverse tasks. As we had a natural sensor to check walls, we needed to add pits that could not be checked by any sensor.}


\imgW{robomission-task2}{Task with asteroids.}


\subsection{Task Editor}
\label{sec:robomission.task-editor}

A part of the system is the task editor (REF: image)
that enables to easily create new tasks.
(TODO: mention how inconvenient it was in the first prototype, especially the tokens...)
(TODO: mention that the task editor is part of the public site, so anybody can create a task, provide a link and ref to details about task format in the next chapter)


\imgW{task-editor}{Task editor allows to create new tasks.}
\imgW{task-editor-vim}{Task editor allows to to write solutions in Python-based RoboCode and edit space world in Vim mode.}


\section{Adaptability}
\label{sec:robomission.adaptability}

TODO: mimic the structure from the AL chapter (e.g. as subsections):
domain model, student model, tutoring policy (task recommendation / mastery decision)

\begin{itemize}
\item levels -- currently 9 - divided based on how many block available (usually one new concept in each level)
\item recommendation -- simple filtering (only consider unsolved tasks on the level $\leq$ student level), simple weighting based on difference between student and task levels (exponential decay), rulette wheel selection
\item TODO: describe current recommendation strategy
\item plus: mini-instructions
\end{itemize}


\imgW{robomission-mini-instruction}{When a student encounters a new programming concept or programming element, the system displays a short instruction.}
\imgW{robomission-mini-explanation}{The system shows an explanation why the exection was unsuccessful.}
\imgW{robomission-levels-credits}{Students earn credits after each solved task.}
\imgW{robomission-tasks-overview}{Overview of all tasks. There is currently 9 levels, each containing about 8 tasks.}

\imgW{prototype-instructions}{Instructions in the first prototype. Nobody was reading them. Most people even did not notice there are any instructions.}


\section{Monitoring and Analysis}
\label{sec:robomission.monitoring}

Even with careful testing, there will always be some errors in the deployed systems.
For example, there might be a task that is much easier than expected,
due to missing limit or some other mistake in its setting.
In addition to the errors in data,  % TODO: fix parallelism
the adpative behavior of the system is extremelly difficult to test as well.
As discused in section \ref{sec:metrics-and-evaluation} is only a proxy for our true objectives
and can be sometimes misleading.
As a result, it is not even more practical, but even neccessary to deploy system
that is imperfect, and then find and fix the problems that arise.
To spot the problems as soon as possible,
monitoring is a crucial component,
that facilites iterative improvement of the system.
% TODO: ref to iterative improvement section / rule of the loop principle

\subsection{Admin Requirements}
\label{sec:admin-requirements}

Similarly to regular users, administrators also have requirements on the systems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Admin can immediately see how much is the system used and how the system behaves with respect to the short-term ("live-evaluation") metrics (...)
\item Admin receives feedback from provided by users, and error reports on unhandled exceptions.
\item Admin can see metrics on individual tasks (to quickly detect issues with a task).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Monitoring Components}

To fulfill the requiremetns from section \ref{sec:admin-requirements},
the system includes the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Google Analytics} --
  shows distribution of users with respect to time and space.
  In addition to page visits,
  it can also process specific events sent from the frontend,
  such as clicking on the execution button,
  and divide them into groups, e.g. by task or group for AB experiment.
  (figure \ref{fig:google-analytics})
\item \textbf{Monitoring Dashboard} (see figure \ref{fig:monitoring-dashboard})
      which shows values of metrics for last month.
      (Computed metrics are described in section \label{sec:robomission.metrics}.)
\item \textbf{User Feedback} --
  a modal form that can be opened by a user on any page
  to send us a message that something is not working as expected.
  Each user feedback is send to the administrators by an email.
\item \textbf{Error Reports} --
  if an unhandled top-level error occur on the server,
  it is not only logged, but also send to the administrators.
\item \textbf{Data Exports} --
  All collected data are every week exported as a zip bundle containing
  CSV files prepared for convenient offline analysis.
\item \textbf{Investigaion Notebook} --
  a template of jupyter notebook with a command that generates exports
  and serves them directly as pandas data frames
  (see figure \ref{fig:investigation-notebook}).
\item \textbf{Logs} --
  all requests, performed actions, unhandled errors and submitted feedback are logged
  to files on the server for manual inspection.
\end{itemize}


\imgW[0.7]{google-analytics}{Preview from Google Analytics (breakdown for "execution" event).}

% TODO: latest dashboard, ideally with readable values
\imgW[0.6]{monitoring-dashboard}{Metrics visualized in the monitoring dashobard.}

% TODO: update investigation notebook (fix error in last cell, current data;
% should show something interesting, or at least some descriptive analylis)
\imgW[0.7]{investigation-notebook}{Template of jupyter notebook for investigation of live data.}


\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:robomission.metrics}

% TODO: include live metrics if there are any
Every night, the system recomputes metrics related to the long-term objectives
(as described in \ref{sec:long-term-objectives}):

\begin{itemize}
\item "daily active students" = number of users who solved at least 1 task this day,
\item "solving hours" = total time spent on successful attempts,
\item "success ratio" = proportion of successful attempts,
\item number of solved tasks.
%\item (TBA: update if it changed)
\end{itemize}


The system also computes metrics about each task (in order to e.g. detect problematic ones):
\begin{itemize}
\item solved count,
\item median time,
\item success ratio.
\end{itemize}




% TODO: consider if to include non-functional requirements or not
%\section{Non-functional Requirements}
%\label{sec:robomission.nonfunctional-requirements}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item easy to understand code, pleasure to read and write (extend)
%\item easy to refactor and add new things (new tasks, levels, recommendation strategies etc.)
%\item robust, efficient, interpretable behavior
%\end{itemize}


\section{Rule of the Loop}
\label{sec:robomission.rule-of-the-loop}

\begin{itemize}
\item the design interleaved with the implementation -> final design is completely different than the original one
\item ref: rule of the loop (ref: in game desing: Book of Lenses, for ML: Google Rules of ML, for WS development: SCRUM; our project includes all these 3 elements)
\item first prototype: 2016, one year of development, thrown away; for testing our initial ideas and find what works and what not; 50 tasks with a robot in maze
  \begin{itemize}
  \item problems with the robot in the maze: not fun (boring, not inovative, repetitiveness), did not allow for a plenty of diverse easy tasks (which is necessary for adaptive systems), required a lot of blocks even for simple programs (compared to the SpaceGame)
  \item problems with the codebase (maintainability, extensibility - why?)
  \item and the good things? (SPA, explored/verified useful technologies, such as Blockly and Django)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

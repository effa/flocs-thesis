\section{Existing Systems for Learning Programming}
\label{sec:existing-systems}

There are many systems for learning programming and they differ from each other
in several significant aspects, which are summarized in \Cref{tbl:existing-systems-categorization}.
In order to be widely available, most of the systems for learning introductory programming
are web applications and do not require any prerequisite other than reading
and using a mouse.
The systems % do not attemp to cover all basic concepts;
often teach only a small subset of programming concepts,
and there is no consensus on which concepts should be practiced first. % and no research
Students usually spend most time by solving tasks, rather than
by reading texts and watching videos.
Most systems focus primarily on motivation and less on efficient learning,
e.g. the sequence of tasks in the tutorials is usually same for every student.

In \cref{sec:lightbot,sec:problem-solving-tutor,sec:blockly-games,sec:hoc,sec:khan-academy},
we briefly present the most notable existing systems,
focusing on their features that support learning or motivation,
which includes tasks with a visual output (e.g. turtle graphics),
and block-based programming to avoid syntax errors.
These successful strategies for teaching programming are described in
more detail in \Cref{sec:strategies-for-easier-learning}.

\subsection{LightBot}
\label{sec:lightbot}
LightBot%
\footnote{\url{http://lightbot.com}}
is a mobile and web application offering a fixed sequence of tasks solved by
a block-based programming language
(\Cref{fig:lightbot}).
Students create short programs to control a robot in a grid world.
The robot can not only walk and turn left or right but also jump and turn on lights.
Having five different basic actions is useful for a diversity of elementary tasks.
The system covers sequences of commands, procedures, simple loops via tail-recursion,
and conditional commands.

%  is similar to LightBot;
%however, it adds a new feature: colored fields.
%Colors can be used in conditional commands,

\subsection{Problem Solving Tutor}
\label{sec:problem-solving-tutor}
Problem Solving Tutor%
\footnote{\url{https://tutor.fi.muni.cz}}
includes a few problem sets for practicing programming,
such as Interactive Python, Turtle Graphics, or Robotanist
% TODO: more precise description of the tasks instead of e.g. "Inter. Python",
% see the reffed paper for inspiration.
\cite{proso}.
Robotanist (\cref{fig:robotanist}) is similar to LightBot,
with an addition of colored fields.
Colors can be used in conditional commands, which allows for diverse tasks,
including difficult problems with complex recursion.  After
each solved task, Problem Solving Tutor shows a recommendation for two next
tasks %(one easier, on more difficult),
with predicted solving times.
Showing predicted time % to the user
serves as a motivational element, posing
a suitable challenge to overcome oneself
\cite{pelanek-student-modeling-times}.

\subsection{Blockly Games}
\label{sec:blockly-games}
Blockly is a popular block-based programming interface.
In contrast to the blocks in LightBot,
Blockly blocks can be nested and assembled arbitrarily %in nested control structures
(\cref{fig:blockly-games}).
Blockly Games%
\footnote{\url{https://blockly-games.appspot.com/}}
consist of several problem sets with Blockly, ordered by increasing difficulty.
For example, in the first level, students learn how to compose blocks together
as a puzzle, and in the second level, they learn loops and conditions by solving
tasks in a maze. Final level serves as a transition from block-based
programming to textual programming in JavaScript.
Each level consists of 5-10 tasks, again ordered by increasing difficulty. %, with no personalization.
The fixed order enables to build on the program from the previous task,
thus gradually leading to more complex programs,
resulting for example in sophisticated images in turtle graphics.
Blockly Games includes non-ignorable interactive instructions,
which require taking a described action before they disappear
\cite{blockly-10-things}.

\subsection{Hour of Code}
\label{sec:hoc}
Hour of Code%
\footnote{\url{https://hourofcode.com}}
provides many one-hour tutorials, each containing about 15 tasks in fixed order,
using Blockly-based language
(\cref{fig:hoc,fig:turtle}).
These tutorials focus on motivation, using themes from popular movies and
games, and providing videos with famous people explaining programming concepts.
The tutorials use high-level theme-specific blocks, such as ``set droid to a
random speed``, or ``create a snowflake branch'',
and they are restricted to only one or two programming
concepts, e.g. sequences of commands and repeat loops. % events.
In some tasks, the built program is not a direct solution for a robot,
but rather a game, in which the code specifies actions triggered on events.

\section{Strategies to Support Learning}
%\section{Strategies for Easier Learning}
\label{sec:strategies-for-easier-learning}

Learning programming is difficult,
  because it requires
  to adopt algorithmic thinking,
  understand program execution,
  and remember the formal syntax of a programming language;
  all these three skills at once. % at the same time.
To make learning easier,
  the systems presented in the previous section use diverse strategies,
  such as avoiding syntax errors,
  displaying visual output
  and providing hints.
Various other strategies were tried in the past as well;
article \emph{Lowering barriers for Novice Programmers}
  \cite{lowering-barriers}
  provides a detailed overview.


\subsection{Avoiding Syntax Errors}
\label{sec:avoiding-syntax-errors}

A common strategy for avoiding syntax errors is to replace textual programming
with drag-and-drop block-based programming.
There are two basic types of block-based interfaces:
  either with a square grid defining the program shape,
  often one row per function
  (\cref{fig:lightbot-robotanist}),
  or the blocks are interlocking and can be assembled and nested arbitrarily,
  with no limit on maximum program length,
  often one vertical stack per function
  (\cref{fig:blockly-hoc}).

The interlocking blocks are more difficult to understand and manipulate with
  than the square grid.
On the other hand, they are more flexible
  and correspond more closely to the usual textual programming.
The square grid does not allow for nesting,
  which is a fundamental feature of computer programs.
This restriction is usually overcome by
  combining condition and commands into a single block,
  by using recursion instead of loops,
  and by replacing nested sequences of commands by a new function.

%TODO: the block-based editors are a special case of "structred editors",
%idea: editor only allows edits that transform the code from one syntactically correct
%program to another (basically working on AST level, edit = transforms to another AST)
%(compared to: classical text editors, where the edit can be arbitraty, making the code
%not syntactically correct).

%\subsection{Potential Drawback of Block-based Interfaces}
%\label{sec:potential-drawback-of-block-based-interfaces}
A drawback of using block-based programming
  is that the students need to learn a proper textual programming language in
  the future to be able to implement more complex programs.
Several controlled experiments were performed to test a hypothesis
  that it is still beneficial to start an introductory programming course
  with a block-based programming,
  even when the students will be writing textual code later in the course
  \cite{comparing-blocks-text-price2015, comparing-blocks-text-weintrop2017}.
Results suggest that block-based interfaces indeed lead to increased learning and
motivation; however, the evidence is not fully convincing. For example, in
some of these studies, the programming interfaces differed in more aspects than
just in using blocks instead of text. Furthermore, these studies do not
answer when it is the right moment to switch from block-based to textual
programming.

%\subsection{Transition Strategy}
%\label{sec:transition-strategy}
%Weintrop and Wilensky suggest that the block representation of the code
To make the transition easier, the block representation of the code
  should match the underlying programming language
  to which the student is expected to move in the next phase
  \cite{challenges-of-blocks-based-environments}.
However, resemblance to a programming language sometimes
  conflicts with the readability of the blocks for novices.
Instead of making compromises,
  the system can progressively change the available set of blocks in each level,
  making them more and more similar to a textual programming language.
In the last level of Blockly Games, which employ this strategy,
  the text on the blocks matches the generated JavaScript exactly
  \cite{blockly-10-things}.

%TODO:
%- note: "blending block-based and text-based programming approaches (e.g., Pencil Code
%(Bau 2015), Tiled Grace (Homer and Noble 2014), and Greenfoot’s Frame-based editor (Kölling et al.
%2015)"


\subsection{Visual Output}
\label{sec:visual-output}

Learning systems can help students to track program execution
  by providing a clear visual representation of the current state
  and effects performed by the program.
This can be achieved naturally for turtle graphics,
  where the whole state is just a position and orientation of the turtle,
  and effects are the drawn lines.
Similarly, in simple games, such as those described in
  \cref{sec:lightbot,sec:problem-solving-tutor,sec:blockly-games,sec:hoc},
  the grid world visualization contains complete information about the current
  state (\cref{fig:lightbot-robotanist,fig:blockly-hoc}).
For the simplicity of their visual output,
  drawings and grid world games have become prevalent task types
  in the current systems for learning programming.

\subsection{Instructions and Hints}
\label{sec:instructions-and-hints}

Most educational systems include instructions
  to explain new concepts such as loops and conditions.
%However, Neil Fraser explains that students ignore instructions,
However, many students ignore instructions,
  no matter how prominent they are \cite{blockly-10-things}.
A solution to this problem are actionable non-ignorable instructions,
  which cannot be closed manually by the student, and disappear only once the
  student performs the action described in the instruction
  (\cref{fig:blockly-games}).

In addition to the instructions, some systems offer hints, which appear either
  upon a student request, or automatically after a certain time of unsuccessful
  solving. Although it is possible to generate a hint in any state,
  using data of students which have successfully solved the task before
  \cite{generating-hints}, most existing systems use a few manually prepared
  hints, instead of relying on the automatic approaches.

\section{Strategies to Support Motivation}
%\section{Strategies for Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
% NOTE: Prev section: learning, this section: engagement.

In addition to strategies for easier learning presented in
\cref{sec:strategies-for-easier-learning}, it is equally important to create an
engaging environment supporting students’ motivation.
All strategies for supporting motivation are based on fulfilling some human
needs \cite{nvc}. % TODO: cite specific page

\subsection{Appealing Game World}
\label{sec:motivation.game-world}
Ideally, game world should appeal to students --
even without tasks to solve,
  it should be an interesting toy to play with \cite{book-of-lenses}.
That is why all Hour of Code tutorials are based on movies and games
  popular among children, such as Angry Birds, Frozen, or Star Wars
  (\cref{fig:hoc}).
In such environments, it is possible to assign open-ended tasks,
  or even let the students create whatever they want,
  which works well especially for creative students seeking for self-expression.
For example, Khan Academy programming curriculum contains many
open-ended drawing projects (\cref{fig:ka}).
%\cref{sec:robomission.game-world}

\subsection{Entertaining Tasks}
\label{sec:motivation.tasks}
For many students, giving them specific small problems works better
  than large, loosely defined, open-ended tasks.
By solving small problems quickly,
  they get a feeling of progress and learning.
Another advantage of closed tasks
  is a more straightforward implementation of gamification features and adaptive behavior.

Small closed tasks result in short programs,
  but their behavior should be still interesting. % for the students to be satisfied.
To achieve complex behavior,
  a system can either provide students with macro-commands (e.g. to draw a circle)
  or with a skeleton of complex code, with a few gaps to fill in by students.
However, it is important for the students to feel ownership over the code,
  which is especially a concern with the code skeleton.
A solution, implemented in Blockly Games,
  is to make a series of tasks in which the students
  build on their program from the previous task
  \cite{blockly-10-things}.

% TODO: some examples in the form of figures + descriptions
% TODO: other important aspects: variability


\subsection{Optimal Challenge}  % OR: "Optimal Difficulty"
\label{sec:motivation.challenge}
For a great learning experience,
  the difficulty of the task must match the skill of the student.
If the task is too easy,
  the student is not challenged and gets bored.
If the task is too difficult,
  the student becomes frustrated and desperate.
On the other hand, if the task has appropriate difficulty,
  the student is likely to be challenged and focused
  (\cref{fig:flow}).
The complete immersion into the task the student is solving at the moment is called
  a state of flow \cite{flow},
  or a \emph{zone of proximal development} \cite{zone-of-proximal-development}.
Achieving the state of flow maximizes the learning outcome \cite{adaptive-practice}.
  % and even increases the long-term level of happiness. % TODO: find a source of this claim
\Cref{chap:adaptive-learning} describes techniques for estimating student's skills
and recommending tasks of optimal difficulty.

\subsection{Gamification and Progress Visualization}

A sense of progress and learning can be boosted by visualizations of
progress towards mastery in the current topic, solved tasks, completed problems sets,
or acquired skills.

%\subsection{Gamification}

Although the programming tasks themselves can be considered as a game,
%(e.g. Human Resource Machine from \cref{sec:human-resource-machine} is presented purely as a game),
most learning systems add further gamification elements to increase the sense
of progress.
Common gamification elements include points, levels, badges, and leaderboards.

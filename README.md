# Master Thesis on Adaptive Programming

This repository contains sources of master thesis on
*Adaptive System for Learning Programming*,
as well as related notes and ideas.

## Mission

Mission of this master thesis is
to make it possible for all children to learn basics of programming efficiently
and maximize the time they spend in the state of flow,
which should in turn maximize both their skill and happiness level.
Working on this ultimate goal, I will learn many useful skills,
discuss questions and issues with my friends
and maximize the amount time me and my friends spent in flow.

## Roles

This is a list of roles which are all important to fully complete my mission.

- *Developer.* I develop the adaptive system and continuously work to improve it.
- *Researcher.* I analyse data from the system and report my findings to the research community.
- *Lab member.* I actively participate in lab seminars and help the other members with their challenges and issues.
- *Student.* I learn new skills every day, from programming, web development and software engineering to artificial intelligence, machine learning, adaptive learning systems, to psychology and teaching.
- *Padawan.* I discuss research challenges with my supervisor and learn from his problem-solving skills. I make sure he can always rely on me and be happy about my work.


## Goals

This is a list of long-term goals which I aim to achieve before the end of 2017, when I plan to finish my Master degree.

1. I will read all good articles in the aria of adaptive learning systems and try relevant adaptive learning systems.
2. I will design and implement models for student, tasks and their interaction and choose suitable metrics for their evaluation.
3. I will design and implement several techniques for task selection and choose or design suitable metric for their evaluation.
4. I will design and implement complete adaptive system with friendly user interface and engaging story and create a suitable domain metric for its evaluation.
5. I will find a way how to reliably measure flow and how to use this concept in the above mentioned metrics.
6. I will make the project codebase an example of beautiful clean code, which will be pleasure to read and easy to extend.
7. I will promote the system so that it will be used by at least 100 user per day and on at least 100 schools.
8. I will take an internship related to adaptive learning systems or machine learning (in summer 2017).
9. I will analyze data from the system and evaluate quality of models, techniques and the complete system.
10. I will describe models, techniques, architecture and their evaluation in my master thesis in a very clean and readable way.

To prepare humanity for the next 100 years, we need more of our children to learn computer programming skills, regardless of their future profession. Along with reading and writing, the ability to program is going to define what an educated person is.}

Programming is becoming an essential skill to learn.
Not only is it useful in increasing number of professions,
but also it develops abstract thinking and problem solving ability. % cite
Our mission is to help children to learn basic programming efficiently,
while supporting their motivation for further learning.
For this purpose, we build a personalized system for learning introductory
programming, RoboMission\footnote{\url{en.robomise.cz}},
that aims to adapt to the skills of the student
to create an optimal learning experience.

%How to build such a system? (make this paragraph an outline)
Many tutorials for introductory programming already exists,
including popular Hour of Code \cite{hour-of-code} with XY students...
They combine several strategies for supporting learning and motivation,
that are based on human needs, strengths, weaknesses and needs.
However, they are not personalized and offer the same sequence of tasks
for everybody.
RoboMission improves upon the existing systems by adapting to the
students using techniques of artificial intelligence.
In addition to the time-tested strategies and artificial intelligence,
it also employs iterative design and improvements based on analyses.

%Artificial intelligence proved to be a powerful tool for tackling difficult problems, from playing chess to driving autonomous cars. % TODO: references
%This thesis explores how we can use artificial intelligence to optimize
%learning of introductory programming.
%This thesis explores how can be artificial intelligence used to optimize

Adaptive learning systems have been already successfully used in many domains
\cite{mathsgarden, alg.evaluation-geography, matmat.response-times}
%, sqltutor}.
% maths += Cognitive Tutor (?mastery-learning-scale), ASSiSTments (Koedinger
% 2010), ALEKS
% TODO: find another domain (avoid another math)
TODO....
Nevertheless, the most popular introductory programming tutorials,
Hours of Code \cite{hour-of-code},
offer the same sequence of tasks for everybody,
leading to a suboptimal experience.
Artificial intelligence can be used to personalize the sequence of tasks.
% for each student.
By giving students tasks of difficulty matching their skill,
%neither too easy, nor too difficult,
we help them to achieve complete immersion into the problem solving
activity (\cref{fig:flow}).
This \emph{state of flow} \cite{flow}
is essential for the optimal learning experience
\cite{adaptive-practice}.

How to design a programming game that supports both learning and motivation?
How to model the domain and students of introductory programming?
% OR: How to estimate skills of the students and how to model learning of IP?
Which algorithms to use for task recommendation and mastery learning?
How to evaluate and iteratively improve components of the adaptive learning system?
%How to evaluate if the adaptivity of the system helps to improve learning and engagement?
% TODO: Make sure these questions are answered in the text (or remove them).
To answer these questions, we not only look at the existing systems
and research, but we also develop our own adaptive learning system for
introductory programming, RoboMission\footnote{Available at \url{en.robomise.cz}}
(\cref{fig:robomission-task1}).
Development of this system helps us to better understand related challenges
and allow us to collect data that we need to support or reject our hypotheses.
% TODO: And are there such hypotheses in the thesis?
% NOTE: RoboMission = app for efficient and engaging learning of introductory
% programming for children (= mission)


We first look at how the introductory programming is taught
in existing online learning systems
(\cref{chap:learning-programming}),
and describe relevant techniques of adaptive learning
(\cref{chap:adaptive-learning}).
%We focus on models of domain and student for introductory programming,
%algorithms for task recommendation and mastery learning,
%and evaluation of the system and its components.
Then we present a new game designed for learning introductory programming
(\cref{chap:design-of-game}),
approach to adaptivity in our system (\cref{chap:design-of-adaptivity}),
and its implementation (\cref{chap:implementation-of-robomission}).
We conclude the thesis with analyses of collected data
(\cref{chap:analysis}).

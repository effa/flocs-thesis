\chapter{Used Technologies}
\label{chap:technologies}

Technolgoies used in the project change quite quickly in order to meet new requirements,
especially on frontend, where the tools and best practices are evolving rapidly.
The following table shows the technologies in spring 2018.

%Table \ref{tbl:technologies} shows overview of the technologies used
%in the project in spring 2018.
%Note that they are gradually evolving, either to meet new requirements,
%or simply to replace old technologies with newer ones.
%This is especially true for frontend, where the tools and best practices
%are evolving rapidly.
%When this project started in 2015,
%we used several at that time popular technologies
%(AngularJS, Bootstrap, bower, grunt)
%which became obsolete during next 2 years,
%so we replaced them by newer ones.
%Many technologies were introduced naturally as the projects grew,
%e.g. Django Rest Framework for REST API,
%or redux-saga for cleaner handling of asynchronous side-effects
%(instead of the originally used redux-thunk).

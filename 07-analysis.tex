In order to get insight into how the deployed system works
and what should we focus on in next iterations,
we analyze collected data.
All analyses in this chapter use data collected  % avoid repeating "collected"
during 4 months (10th November 2017 -- 9th March 2018).
This data, as well as the code performing the analyses, are available
as attachments of this thesis
(described in \cref{sec:attachment.collected-data,sec:attachment.analyses}).


\section{Data Description}

During the 4 months, about 1000 users tackled at least one task,
%\footnote{The true number of unique users might be lower, because a single user
%may be counted multiple times if he had not signed up and used the system again
%after a session cookie had expired. However, the Google Analytics suggests
%that the number is approximately correct.},
and 800 of them solved at least one task.
About 100 students returned and solved another task another day.
\Cref{fig:engagement-curves} shows complete engagement curves.
% TODO (GA):
Nearly all users access the webpage on a desktop computer ($94\%$).
% TODO: and does any of the mobile-users solved any task? (because that would be very difficult)
% Desktop 94%, Mobile 4%, Tablet 2%

About 11000 tasks were attempted (counting only those attempts with at least one edit),
and 9600 of them were solved,
resulting in the overall success rate $86\%$.
The daily numbers of solved task sessions are not stable,
with high peaks on days when the application was used
in a competition or testing at a school
(\cref{fig:solved-count}).
% The following can be a separate paragraph, if another
% analysis is performed.
Over 180 thousand program snapshots was collected,
from which 140 thousand corresponds to edits,
and 40 thousand to executions.

Median solving time is 1 minute (interquartile range: 24--145 seconds).
Solving times follow log-normal distribution (\cref{fig:solving-times-all}),
so the mean solving time is much higher
(about 3 minutes). %195 seconds, % with high standard deviation of nearly 500 seconds.

\section{System Behavior}

We can use collected data to check the requirements on system behavior mentioned in
\cref{sec:robomission.behavior}. Unfortunatelly, the system is currently not logging
which tasks were recommended and which were self-selected, so we cannot say
how much are the results influenced by the adaptive behavior of the system.
From all attempts, 86\% were successful, and 84\% were solved in less than 15 minutes.
If we look at the first 5 tasks for each student, 87\% of them are solved,
85\% are solved in less than 15 minutes, but only 66\% in less than 2 minutes.
The median solving time is below a minute for the first 10 practiced tasks,
and it does not increase too much for the later attempts either (\cref{fig:solving-times}),
% TODO: comment this observation: ... because most of the students are in the first 4 levels
% + possibly amplified by attrition bias (worst students drops out)
% + random recommendation of tasks from lower level + learning

% TODO: how to create horizontal space between them?

\end{figure}


After 10 minutes of practice, 73\% of students have reached the second level,
and after 20 minutes, nearly 70\% of students have started practicing loops.
Then the progress through levels slows down and only 37\% of students
are practicing both loops and conditional statements after the first
hour of the tutorial (\cref{fig:students-at-levels}).

\section{Performance Measurement}

% In ... we have discussed importance of a performance compression
Measurement of performance has a huge impact on the estimated skills in the student model,
and transitively on the behavior of the tutor model, e.g. which task is recommended
to the student.
Currently, we measure %three-valued performance representation, and a
performance using only observed solving time
(\cref{sec:robomission.student}).
However, due to variations in speeds of different students
(which are even partially influenced by external factors, such as used device),
solving time is rather noisy approximation of the true performance.
Could using other observational data, such as number of edits,
bring more information about the performance?

%(TODO: Goal: find a compression function that maximizes performance of student model.)
Overall Pearson correlation between solving times and number of edits (both
log-transformed) is quite high, about 0.73 (\cref{fig:performance-corrs-ts}).
However, if computed for individual tasks,
median correlation drops to 0.64, % (interquartile range 0.5 -- 0.72),
and $25\%$ of tasks have a correlation below 0.5 % check the number
(\cref{fig:time-vs-edits}), which suggests that incorporating number of edits into the
measurement should be at least considered.

We propose the following heuristic for combining solving times with the number of edits and runs: log-transformed sum of edits, runs, and \emph{thinking actions}.
To reduce noise caused e.g. by different screen sizes,
%and idvidiual speeds of students,
thinking action is only assumed between two edits
or runs, if the time interval is at least 5 seconds (which seems to be enough
to drag and drop a block anywhere on any screen). If the interval is very long,
we count it as multiple thinking actions (taking $log_5$ from the time interval
and rounding it down to the closest integer).
This heuristic retains reasonable correlation with both solving time
and number of edits for all tasks (\cref{fig:performance-corrs-p10}).

% the same with thresholds derived from task median (computing 3-level performance)
% -> measure agreement on all task sessions (not correlation, because specific
%  values are now important; prabably RMSE to penalize larger discrepances severaly).
% TODO: 3rd level of abstraction:
% - explore influence of different aggregations, e.g. all-mean (default), min-per-task, median-per-task,
% - explore the role of thresholds
% - explore influence of error metrics; of number of levels
% - explore usage in predictive models on the next performance (independent/cross)
% - explore the action-count measure (with thresholds): e.g. how it behaves wrt. incrasing levels

\section{Task Difficulties}

% Reformulate to make it clear, that it is the analysis before introduction of the phases,
% that actually leads to the refinement described in the thesis.

% TODO: Resolve mission vs. level.
Our tutor model (\cref{robomission.tutor}) assumes that difficulties of tasks
in each phase are approximately the same,
and that the overall difficulty is increasing as the level increases.   % even phase.
Using collected data, we can determine whether these assumption are satisifed,
and if not, suggest adjustments to improve their validity.
\Cref{fig:solving-times} (right) shows that on average the difficulty of levels
is increasing, but it also reveals that level 7 is more difficult than level 8.
Levels 3 and 4 have similar difficulty, which is expected because they practice
two similar concepts, repeat and while loops.

% TODO: Elaborate on the solution to this issue.
% (TODO?: phases instead of missions, and select only a few to save space)
Looking at the difficulty of individual tasks (\cref{fig:difficulties-tasks-levels})
help us to discover outliers, whose difficulty is significantly
different from the other tasks in the same level.
The \cref{fig:difficulties-tasks-levels} also suggests that dividing levels
into phases is necessary to achieve reasonable homogenity. For example, in the 2nd
level (World), there are two clear groups of tasks with significantly different
difficulty. Although in the other levels such a clear split does not exist,
they still contain tasks with a wide range of difficulties. %, so the refinement into phases seems appropriate.
% TODO: note/analyze robustness of these analyses (given the limited data)

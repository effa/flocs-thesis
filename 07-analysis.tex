\chapter{Analysis of Collected Data}
\label{chap:analysis}

In order to get insight into how the deployed system works
and what should be improved, we analyze collected data.
All analyses in this chapter use data collected  % avoid repeating "collected"
during 4 months (10th November 2017 -- 9th March 2018).


\section{Data Description}

During the 4 months, about 1000 users tackled at least one task,
%\footnote{The true number of unique users might be lower, because a single user
%may be counted multiple times if he had not signed up and used the system again
%after a session cookie had expired. However, the Google Analytics suggests
%that the number is approximately correct.},
and 800 of them solved at least one task.
About 100 students returned and solved another task another day.
\Cref{fig:engagement-curves} shows complete engagement curves.
% TODO (GA):
Nearly all users access the webpage on a desktop computer ($94\%$).
% TODO: and does any of the mobile-users solved any task? (because that would be very difficult)
% Desktop 94%, Mobile 4%, Tablet 2%

About 11000 tasks were attempted (counting only thosse with at least one edit),
and 9600 of them were solved,
resulting in the overall success rate $86\%$.
The daily numbers of solved task sessions are not stable,
with high peaks on days when the application was used
in a competition or testing at a school
(\cref{fig:daily-task-sessions}).
% The following can be a separate paragraph, if another
% analysis is performed.
Over 180 thousand program snapshots was collected,
from which 140 thousand corresponds to edits,
and 40 thousand to executions.

Median solving time is 60 seconds (interquartile range: 24-145 seconds).
Solving times follow log-normal distribution (\cref{fig:solving-times}),
so the mean solving time is much higher (even if the times are capped at one hour):
195 seconds, with high standard deviation of nearly 500 seconds.

\section{Performance Compression}

% In ... we have discussed importance of a performance compression
Our student model uses three-valued performance representation, and
a performance compression function based purely on observed solving time
(\cref{sec:robomission.student}).
Would using other observational data, such as number of edits
bring more information about the performance?
(TODO: Goal: find a compression function that maximizes performance of
student model.)

Overall Pearson correlation between solving times and number of edits (both
log-transformed) is quite high (0.73). However, if computed for individual tasks,
median correlation drops to 0.64, % (interquartile range 0.5 -- 0.72),
and $25\%$ of tasks have a correlation below 0.5 % check the number
(\cref{fig:time-vs-edits}), which suggests that incorporating number of edits
(or executions) should be at least considered.

\label{fig:time-vs-edits}
\end{figure}


\section{Task Difficulties}

% TODO: Resolve mission vs. level.
Our tutor model (\cref{robomission.tutor}) assumes that difficulties of tasks
in a phase are approximately same,
and that the overall difficulty is increasing as the level increases.   % even phase.
Using collected data, we can determine whether these assumption are satisifed,
and if not, suggest adjustments to improve their validity.

\Cref{fig:solving-times} (right) shows that on average the difficulty of levels
is increasing, but it also reveals that level 7 is more difficult than level 8.
% TODO: Elaborate on the solution to this issue.
% (TODO?: phases instead of missions, and select only a few to save space)
Looking at the difficulty of individual tasks (\cref{fig:difficulties-tasks-levels})
help us to discover outliers, whose difficulty is significantly
different from the other tasks in the same level.
The \cref{fig:difficulties-tasks-levels} also suggests that dividing levels
into phases is necessary to achieve reasonable homogenity. For example, in the 2nd
level (World), there are two clear groups of tasks with significantly different
difficulty. Although in the other levels such a clear split does not exist,
they still often contain tasks with a wide range of difficulties.
% TODO: note/analyze robustness of these analyses (given the limited data)

% TODO: only a first 6 levels or possibly devide into phases

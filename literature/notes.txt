## Adaptive Practice: High-Efficiency Game-Based Learning
**[adaptive-practice]**
- Thomas Butt, 2012
- goal: easy, fast and fun learning
- "If it is possible that a student can effectively learn something in 10 seconds, it shouldn't take 11"
- for learning, what a student thinks is more important than what we teach
- how practice helps to build long-term memories
- flow
  - "the sweet spot of learning"
  - not too easy, not too hard
  - balance between boredom (apathy) and frustration
  - then we enjoy thinking and learning


## Stupid Tutoring Systems, Intelligent Humans
**[stupid-tutoring-system]**
- Ryan S. Baker
- idea: instead of developing intelligent systems, develop systems intelligently
  (focus on "intelligence amplification" rather than "artificial intelligence")
- gap between papers (complex models) and real systems (e.g. "3 in a row")


## Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction
**[ladder-of-abstraction]**
- Bret Victor, 2011
- online: http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/
- interesting challenges lies on the boundary between the known and the unknown
- to explore this boundary, it's useful to move between levels of abstraction
  (analogy: new place -> low-level walking on streets + high-level map)
- control: interactive control of each parameter
- abstraction: representation depicting behavior for all possible values
- abstract time (independent variable), algorithm, data (environment)
- but always be able to interactively step down to a more concrete layer
- step up -> to see a pattern -> step down -> to find explanation
- ok to start with terrible system
  - explore it to find why and how it's terrible
  - develop understanding, get ideas for improvement
  - develop metrics for summarizing some aspect of the behavior

## Adaptive Practice: High-Efficiency Game-Based Learning [adaptive-practice]
- Thomas Butt, 2012
- goal: easy, fast and fun learning
- "If it is possible that a student can effectively learn something in 10 seconds, it shouldnâ€™t take 11"
- for learning, what a student thinks is more important than what we teach
- how practice helps to build long-term memories
- flow
  - "the sweet spot of learning"
  - not too easy, not too hard
  - balance between boredom (apathy) and frustration
  - then we enjoy thinking and learning


## Stupid Tutoring Systems, Intelligent Humans [stupid-tutoring-systems]
- Ryan S. Baker
- idea: instead of developing intelligent systems, develop systems intelligently
  (focus on "intelligence amplification" rather than "artificial intelligence")
- gap between papers (complex models) and real systems (e.g. "3 in a row")

%\section{Summary}
%\label{sec:conclusion.summary}

This thesis describes how a combination of several strategies to support
learning and motivation, together with the adaptivity of the system
through techniques of artificial intelligence,
can lead to an efficient learning of introductory programming. % too strong?
Creating such a system is, however, not a one-shot task, but rather a long series
of small iterative improvements of a programming game,
models of domain, student and tutor, user interface, and the analysis layer.

With our adaptive system for learning programming, RoboMission,
we have already completed a few iterations of improvements.
% our adaptive learning system for introductory programming,
Since its first prototype, which was implemented in 2015,
%we use the feedback from users (as well as collected data?)
we have completely changed both the programming game and the adaptive behavior.
The version deployed in November 2017 was used during the following 4 months
by about 1000 users, who solved about 10000 tasks.
We tested its usability at schools during Hours of Code,
as well as in two competitions for primary and secondary school students,
Purkiáda\footnote{\url{http://purkiada.sspbrno.cz}} and
InterSoB\footnote{\url{https://intersob.math.muni.cz/2018/}}.

%\section{Future Work}
%\label{sec:conclusion.future-work}

Many improvement iterations are yet to be undertaken. After adding
new game elements and programming concepts (e.g. functions and compound
conditions), it will be possible to create more advanced problem sets,
and extend the use case of the system beyond the short motivational tutorial.
% (\emph{Hour of Code mode}).  % grammar
Tasks could gradually transition from block-based to Python programming,
and teach even advanced algorithmic concepts (\cref{fig:robomission-search-tree}).
Next, we plan to implement a real-time dashboard for teachers,
which would visualize progress %and skills
of students and suggest
which students need a help right now, and possibly even how to pair students
for efficient pair programming.

%In \emph{foundations mode}, students could spend from a few days to several weeks practicing
%programming, transitioning gradually from block-based to textual programming
%in RoboCode.
%% missions for learning new programming elements, esp. functions and compound conditions
%% Usage: for a standard primary-secondary school programming curriculum.
%Then, in \emph{university mode} targeting at high school and university students,
%tasks would teach programming in Python, and possibly even advanced algorithmic
%concepts (\cref{fig:robomission-search-tree}).
%% at home / secondary schools, KSI (0th problem set), IB111 (0th/1st motivational lesson)
%Furthermore, we would like to introduce a \emph{competition mode}, for
%straightforward usage of new tasks in a programming contest,
%leaving these problem sets public for everybody for practice once the
%competition is over.
% Competitions --  (both blocks and Python depending on the competition) such as Purkiada, Pevnost FI, KSI, InterLos, InterSob, new FIBot (new problem sets -> public for everybody for practice after the competition; %this also includes testing mode for RH interns
% 5. Cooperation: multiplayer programming game

With growing content, it would become useful to build more complex
domain, student and tutor models. In order to add overlapping concepts
into the domain and use them to more accurately predict student performance,
we need to analyze how multiple skills interact in a single
task to produce the final performance. %, in order to predict performance.
% in a single task. % to produce a single performance.
Using data from a single task session,
we want to detect which concepts contained in the task
is the student struggling with.
Models might be further improved by including uncertainty of estimates,
forgetting of skills, and planning of tutor actions.

To evaluate which versions of models improve the learning and motivation, %increase the learquality of the system,
analysis layer should be extended to allow for AB experiments
% In addition to compare several versions of student or tutor models,
% ... experiment on block-based vs text-based programming
and a careful attention should be paid to both long-term and
online attributable metrics.
We need to make sure that we collect enough data for reliable unbiased evaluation,
which is complicated by feedback loops caused by the fact that
the collected data which the system is evaluated on are influenced by the
adaptive behavior of the system itself.
% and long-term metrics monitoring, simulated experiments
In order to further align measured metrics with the system mission,
we can explore how to reduce noise in flow observations
by combining subjective user feedback with objective performance measures.
Having a reliable flow observations would be a great step towards optimizing
the total amount of time spent in the state of flow.
